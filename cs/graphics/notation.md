# Notation

I commonly use different letters for vector components, especially position and velocity, since they appear a lot in graphics math:

$$\mathbf{u} = (u, v, w), \quad \mathbf{x} = (x, y, z)$$

I prefer bold, non-italic vector notation, and use parentheses to indicate a general vector, which by default are column vectors:

$$\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z) = \begin{bmatrix}
    x \\ y \\ z
\end{bmatrix}$$

For multivariate functions, I use multiple argument and vector argument notation interchangeably:

$$f(x, y, z) = f(\mathbf{x})$$

I also prefer separate function component names for vector functions, and often omit arguments in this form:

$$\mathbf{f}(x) = (f(x), g(x) h(x)) = (f, g, h)$$
